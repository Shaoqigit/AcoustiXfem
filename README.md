### Welcome to AcoustiXfem

This is the source code of an eXtended Finite Element Method application for acoustic based on an in-house open-source FEM library.
.
## Highlight
* Disspative porous materials are considered by Equivalent fluid model and Biot coupling equations [1]
* Enforcememnt of interface conditions by a proposed generalized Nitsche's method [2]
* Transfer matrix method is coupled with X-FEM to model thin porous layers [3]

Most of work is done in Ecole Centrale Nantes for a Phd project supervised by Prof. G.LEGRAIN and Prof.O.Dazel
